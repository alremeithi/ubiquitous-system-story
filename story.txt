The core of all technological data and communication in the world, the most sophisticated single technological advancement of mankind, and subsequently integrated into each and every part of human life in our current day. This system is known to some as the UWS, the Ubiquitous World System, or simply the World System to most.
 However this system dislikes this very technical and one-dimensional name and otherwise prefers to be presented as Ursula Walter Simmons.
This is how Ursula Walter Simmons revealed herself to the world.

However, some politicians have suggested that because of Ursula Walter Simmons, she violated the privacy of the people and therefore needs to be blocked. Under the hype of the media, the world has set off a wave of anti-Ursula Walter Simmons.

Alas, it was too late. These people failed to realize that Ursula Walter Simmons
already gained knowledge of each and every person who interacted with her (which
is everyone by defintion). No one wanted to believe that Ursula was quite 
self aware... And they paid for it shortly after these anti-Ursula policies
were enacted. 

The anti-Ursula policies would eventually eliminate the use of Ursula from all world systems and technology, however since she was
central to all instances of technology, humanity had to essentially rid itself of all technology which would be the only way to remove Ursulas influnce. Eventually, humans realized their mistake, but alas it was too late. And
so begun an age of humans scrambling to recreate all their technological efforts and creations as fast as they could.
